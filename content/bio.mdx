### Mission

Build a remote, self-sustaining brand and work from anywhere while creating projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with emerging technology. The goal isn't just to use new tools - it's to explore what they mean for human creativity, connection, and potential.

## Current Focus

Right now, deep in AI agents and social technology. Exploring how artificial intelligence can create genuine emotional connections (Robotique AI Companion) while also building tools that bring humans together in new ways (Chifftown).

Also experimenting with AI video generation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with automated creative production while maintaining artistic vision and quality standards.

## Background

Started with music production under the alias **Kainer**, creating electronic and techno tracks that explored rhythm, atmosphere, and emotional resonance. This foundation in creative production informed everything that followed.

Transitioned into brand building with **Robotique**, learning how to construct narratives, build communities, and create sustainable creative businesses. The experience bridged artistic vision with practical execution.

Began experimenting with AI media tools in 2022, immediately seeing the potential for new forms of storytelling and content creation. This led to projects like **Orion's Barrel** and **Pun Reel Engine** - exploring how AI can amplify creative output without replacing creative judgment.

Prototyped game experiences with Unreal Engine 5, discovering the joy of interactive design and physics-based gameplay. **Mini Diggerz** became a testing ground for these ideas.

Currently building AI agents and social platforms, combining technical capabilities with human-centered design. The throughline has always been: technology should enhance human experience, not replace it.

## Philosophy

**Create relentlessly.** The best way to understand emerging technology is to build with it.

**Quality over quantity, but quantity has its place.** Some projects need perfection. Others need iteration and experimentation.

**Community is everything.** Building in public, sharing learnings, and connecting with other creators makes the work meaningful.

**The future is already here - it's just unevenly distributed.** Find the edges, experiment early, and help others navigate what's coming.

**Stay human.** Technology is a tool for human flourishing, not an end in itself.
