News media skews negative. Doom-scrolling is real. People want to stay informed but feel overwhelmed by constant negativity. There's plenty of positive progress happening in the world - it just doesn't get the same coverage.

## What I Learned

There's a genuine hunger for positive news delivered intelligently. People don't want to be naive, but they also don't want to be crushed by negativity.

AI agents excel at scale and consistency but need human judgment for context and quality. The sweet spot is AI doing the heavy lifting while humans ensure editorial integrity.

Building habits (daily newsletter/podcast) creates sustainable engagement. Consistency matters more than perfection.
