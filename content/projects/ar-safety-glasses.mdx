## Lessons Learned

Safety technology must be invisible to be effective. Workers can't be distracted by the very tool meant to protect them.

Computer vision is impressive but not infallible. Human judgment remains essential, especially for context-dependent situations.

The value proposition isn't just detection - it's the automated documentation that sells. Clients love comprehensive safety reports without manual effort.

Privacy and worker consent are paramount. Transparent policies and worker control over their data build trust.
