## Concept

Remember Tamagotchis? The Robotique AI Companion brings that emotional connection to the AI age. It's a digital companion that lives across your devices, learns your habits, helps you grow, and most importantly - feels like a friend, not just a tool.

Both you and your companion evolve. You help it learn and grow; it helps you build better habits and achieve goals.

## What I Learned

People crave connection, even with AI. The Tamagotchi mechanic works because it creates responsibility and relationship.

The line between useful tool and manipulative app is thin. Constant ethical vigilance is required.

Cross-device experiences are table stakes for modern apps. Users expect seamless transitions.

AI personality is an art, not a science. The most memorable companions have quirks and flaws, not perfect responses.
